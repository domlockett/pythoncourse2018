## pick a search criteria for groups, such as a zip code or a search term, like in class. Then answer the following with the returned results:
##      1. Which group is the most popular (i.e., has the most members)? 
##      2. For this group, which member is the most active (i.e., belongs to the most groups)?
##      3. Considering only the most active userâ€™s groups, which group is the most popular?
